# Picbait - An Instagram "Clone"

"Clone" is purposely placed between quotes above. _Picbait_ is very unlikely to become a fully fledged reproduction. What it will be is certainly Instagram inspired, though. I hope. Who knows? Anyway, let's get cracking.

## Aim

Put together a full-stack, bottom-up web application. APIs, CRUD, single-page functionality, the works.

## Intended Features

### _Non-essential features are italicised below_

- **Users**
  - People can sign up to the site. Pick a username and password.
  - Users will have a profile, showing all their images, with links to profile info.
  - Users can follow each other. Profiles will show numbers of followers, and who the profile owner is following.
  - _Users can choose an avatar, or otherwise have a default avatar assigned._
- **Images**
  - Users can post images to their profiles.
  - Users can like images.
  - _Images can be tagged._
  - _Images can be geotagged._
- **Feed**
  - Users get a custom feed of images posted by people they follow.
  - Feed is infinitely scrolling.
- **Comments**
  - Users can comment on images.
  - _Users can like comments._
  - Comments include links to commenter profiles.
