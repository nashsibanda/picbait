# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Seeds provided in db/seeds/* - ensure seedbank gem is installed and included
# in the Gemfile, then run db:seed to seed database. It will take a while to
# pull images into posts and user avatars; sorry!
